Tests of the underlying spawn/async functionality of `Domain` and

   `create`/`join` based on a random `create` tree


Development tests
-----------------

During development we use examples with known problems to help ensure
that concurrency issues are indeed found as expected (aka. sanity
check).

For `Lin.Internal` and `Lin`
- [neg_tests/lin_internal_tests_common.ml](neg_tests/lin_internal_tests_common.ml) and
- [neg_tests/lin_tests_common.ml](neg_tests/lin_tests_common.ml)

contain "sanity check tests" for an unprotected global `ref` and a
buggy concurrent list over unboxed `int` and boxed `int64` types.

For `STM`
 - [neg_tests/stm_tests_ref_spec.ml](neg_tests/stm_tests_ref_spec.ml) and
 - [neg_tests/stm_tests_clist_spec.ml](neg_tests/stm_tests_clist_spec.ml)

contain similar tests.
