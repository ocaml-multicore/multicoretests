Tests of the kcas library
=========================

The kcas library predates the OCaml multicore memory model described
in the [PLDI'18-paper](https://kcsrk.info/papers/pldi18-memory.pdf).
Since then kcas has been subsumed by the Atomic module that was added
to the Stdlib.

This is a placeholder for a few experimental tests of the kcas
library, developed before I realized the above.
