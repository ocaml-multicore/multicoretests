# Multicoretests

This project hosts 4 opam packages:

- `multicoretests` - a property-based test suite of the OCaml
   multicore runtime system and standard library
- `qcheck-lin` - a testing library based on QCheck that generates
   and checks parallel tests for sequential consistency
- `qcheck-stm` - a model-based state-machine testing library based on
   QCheck that can generate both sequential and parallel tests
- `qcheck-multicoretests-util` - a small library of utility functions
   for QCheck-based testing of multicore programs
