# Changes

## NEXT RELEASE

- ...

## 0.9

- #566: Use `QCheck.Print` combinators in `Util.Pp` too for consistency,
        e.g., to avoid that `STM` argument and result printer outputs differ.
- #562: Fix the `int32` and `int64` printers in both `Lin` and `STM` to add
        missing `l` and `L` suffixes on literals.
- #560: Change `Lin.{constructible,deconstructible}` from an empty variant type
        to an abstract type to get `Lin` compiling on `5.5.0+trunk` again, due
        to https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/13994 removing special handling
        of abstract and empty variants defined in the current module.

## 0.8

- #540: Significantly increase the probability of context switching in `Lin_thread`
        and `STM_thread` by utilizing `Gc.Memprof` callbacks. Avoid on 5.0-5.2
        without `Gc.Memprof` support.
- #546: Speed up `Lin`'s default `string` and `bytes` shrinkers.
- #547: Add `Util.Pp.{cst4,cst5}`

## 0.7

- #509: Change/Fix to use a symmetric barrier to synchronize domains
- #511: Introduce extended specs to allow wrapping command sequences
- #517: Add `Lin` combinators `seq_small`, `array_small`, and `list_small`

## 0.6

- No changes to the opam-released library packages.
  Two significant additions to the test suite in the `multicoretests` opam package:
  - #463: Dynarray tests
  - #469: Add gc tests

## 0.5

- #492: Also use the new, upstreamed `Gen.exponential` combinator in STM
- #491: Require `qcheck.0.23`, simplify show functions by utilizing it, and update
  expect outputs accordingly
- #486: Add `Util.Pp.pp_fun_` printer for generated `QCheck.fun_` functions

## 0.4

- #415: Remove `--verbose` in internal `mutable_set_v5` expect test to avoid
  a test failure on a slow machine
- #443: Add `Lin_domain.stress_test` as a lighter stress test, not
  requiring an interleaving search.
- #462: Add `STM_domain.stress_test_par`, similar to `Lin_domain.stress_test`
  for STM models.
- #472: Switch `arb_cmds` to use an exponential distribution with a
  mean of 10, avoiding lists of up to 10000 cmds in `STM_sequential`
  (reported by @nikolaushuber).

## 0.3

- #400: Catch and delay exceptions in `STM`'s `next_state` for a nicer UX
- #387: Reduce needless allocations in `Lin`'s sequential consistency
  search, as part of an `Out_channel` test cleanup
- #379: Extend the set of `Util.Pp` pretty-printers and teach them to
  add break hints similar to `ppx_deriving.show`; teach `to_show` to
  generate truncated strings when `$MCTUTILS_TRUNCATE` environment
  variable is set
- #368: Switch `STM_domain.agree_prop_par_asym` from using
  `Semaphore.Binary` to using an `int Atomic.t` which improves
  the error rate across platforms and backends

## 0.2

- #342: Add two submodules of combinators in `Util`:
  - `Pp` to pretty-print values back to valid OCaml syntax
  - `Equal` to test equality of values
- #337: Add 3 `Bytes.t` combinators to `Lin`: `bytes`, `bytes_small`, `bytes_small_printable`
- #329,340,352: Support `qcheck-lin` and `qcheck-stm` on OCaml 4.12.x, 4.13.x and 4.14.x
                without the `Domain` and `Effect` modes
- #316: Fix `rep_count` in `STM_thread` so that negative and positive
  tests repeat equally many times
- #318: avoid repetitive interleaving searches in `STM_domain` and `STM_thread`
- #312: Escape and quote `bytes` printed with `STM`'s `bytes` combinator
- #295: ensure `cleanup` is run in the presence of exceptions in
  - `STM_sequential.agree_prop` and `STM_domain.agree_prop_par`
  - `Lin_thread.lin_prop` and `Lin_effect.lin_prop`

## 0.1.1

- #263: Cleanup resources after each domain-based `Lin` test
- #281: Escape and quote strings printed with `STM`'s `string` combinator

## 0.1

The initial opam release of `qcheck-lin`, `qcheck-stm`, and
`qcheck-multicoretests-util`.

The `multicoretests` package is not released on opam, as it is of
limited use to OCaml developers.
